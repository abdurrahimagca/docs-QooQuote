## Authentication

#### Creating a new user

Users can create a new account by providing their email and password.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant Frontend as Frontend
    participant Backend as Backend
    participant DB as Database

    User->>Frontend: Enter email and password
    Frontend->>Backend: Send sign-up request
    Backend->>Backend: Validate input
    Backend->>Backend: Hash password
    Backend->>DB: Save user data (email, hashed password)
    DB-->>Backend: Confirmation
    Backend-->>Frontend: Sign-up successful
    Frontend-->>User: Account created
```

Users can also sign up using their Spotify or Pinterest account.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant Frontend as Frontend
    participant Backend as Backend
    participant OAuth as Spotify/Pinterest
    participant DB as Database

    User->>Frontend: Select Spotify/Pinterest sign-up
    Frontend->>Backend: Send sign-up request
    Backend->>OAuth: Request user authentication
    OAuth-->>Backend: Return user data (ID, email, etc.)
    Backend->>DB: Save user data (OAuth provider details)
    DB-->>Backend: Confirmation
    Backend-->>Frontend: Sign-up successful
    Frontend-->>User: Account created
```

#### Logging in

At this point, we do not plan to use an external auth provider like Auth0, but we might consider it in the future. Either way, the architecture would remain the same, with the only difference being the external provider handling the authentication process.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant Frontend as Frontend
    participant Backend as Backend
    participant DB as Database
    participant JWT as JWT Service

    User->>Frontend: Enter email and password
    Frontend->>Backend: Send login request
    Backend->>DB: Validate user credentials
    DB-->>Backend: Return user data (if valid)
    Backend->>JWT: Generate JWT (Access + Refresh tokens)
    JWT-->>Backend: Return tokens
    Backend-->>Frontend: Login successful (Send tokens)
    Frontend-->>User: Logged in

    Note over Frontend, User: Frontend stores tokens securely (e.g., HTTP-only cookies)
```

Nowadays, the most common way to handle authentication is by using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). This is a secure way to authenticate users and keep them logged in. The frontend stores the JWT tokens securely (e.g., in HTTP-only cookies) and sends them with every request to the backend. The backend then verifies the tokens and allows access to the requested resources if the tokens are valid. It is common to make users log in again after a certain period of inactivity, or when the access token expires. In this case, the frontend can use the refresh token to get a new access token without the user having to log in again.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant Frontend as Frontend
    participant Backend as Backend
    participant JWT as JWT Service

    User->>Frontend: Make an API request
    Frontend->>Backend: Send request with Access Token
    Backend->>JWT: Validate Access Token
    alt Token is valid
        JWT-->>Backend: Token valid
        Backend-->>Frontend: Process API request
        Frontend-->>User: Return response
    else Token is invalid or expired
        JWT-->>Backend: Token invalid
        Backend->>Frontend: Request token refresh
        Frontend->>Backend: Send Refresh Token
        Backend->>JWT: Validate and issue new tokens
        JWT-->>Backend: Return new Access and Refresh tokens
        Backend-->>Frontend: New tokens issued
        Frontend->>Backend: Retry API request with new Access Token
        Backend-->>Frontend: Process request and return response
        Frontend-->>User: Return response
    end
```
## Posts 

### Creating a new post

Users can create new posts. They can add a title, description, and tags to their post. They can also add images and videos to their post.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant Frontend as Frontend
    participant Backend as Backend
    participant DB as Database

    User->>Frontend: Create post request (tag, post_text, media, public, etc.)
    Frontend->>Backend: Send post payload
    Backend->>Backend: Validate payload (e.g., required fields)
    alt Payload valid
        Backend->>DB: Store post data
        DB-->>Backend: Confirm post stored
        Backend-->>Frontend: Return success response (post ID, etc.)
        Frontend-->>User: Post created successfully
    else Payload invalid
        Backend-->>Frontend: Return error response (validation failed)
        Frontend-->>User: Display error message
    end
```

### Reposting

Users can repost content they find interesting, similar to retweeting.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant Frontend as Frontend
    participant Backend as Backend
    participant DB as Database

    User->>Frontend: Click repost on a post
    Frontend->>Backend: Send repost request (original post ID)
    Backend->>DB: Create repost entry
    DB-->>Backend: Confirm repost stored
    Backend->>DB: Update original post metrics
    DB-->>Backend: Confirm metrics updated
    Backend-->>Frontend: Return success response
    Frontend-->>User: Repost successful
```

### Deleting a post

Users can delete their own posts.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant Frontend as Frontend
    participant Backend as Backend
    participant DB as Database

    User->>Frontend: Request post deletion
    Frontend->>Backend: Send delete request
    Backend->>Backend: Verify user ownership
    alt User owns post
        Backend->>DB: Mark post as deleted
        DB-->>Backend: Confirm deletion
        Backend-->>Frontend: Return success response
        Frontend-->>User: Post deleted successfully
    else User doesn't own post
        Backend-->>Frontend: Return error response
        Frontend-->>User: Permission denied
    end
```

### Archiving a post

Users can archive posts to hide them from their public profile while keeping them for personal reference.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant Frontend as Frontend
    participant Backend as Backend
    participant DB as Database

    User->>Frontend: Request post archive
    Frontend->>Backend: Send archive request
    Backend->>Backend: Verify user ownership
    alt User owns post
        Backend->>DB: Update post status to archived
        DB-->>Backend: Confirm archive status
        Backend-->>Frontend: Return success response
        Frontend-->>User: Post archived successfully
    else User doesn't own post
        Backend-->>Frontend: Return error response
        Frontend-->>User: Permission denied
    end
```


## Feed

The core of an app like QooQuote is the feed. This is where users can see posts from other users. The feed can be filtered by tags, and users can like and comment on posts. The feed is a complex system that requires a lot of work to get right. We are planning to use a *cumulative filtering* system to show the posts to the user. This means that we will filter the posts by tags, and then by the user's preferences. This way, the user will see the most relevant posts first.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant Frontend as Frontend
    participant Backend as Backend
    participant RecoSystem as Recommendation System
    participant DB as Database

    User->>Frontend: Request recommendations
    Frontend->>Backend: Forward recommendation request
    Backend->>RecoSystem: Fetch personalized recommendations
    RecoSystem->>DB: Query user data and preferences
    DB-->>RecoSystem: Return user data and preferences
    RecoSystem->>DB: Query recommendation data (e.g., posts, tags, media)
    DB-->>RecoSystem: Return relevant data
    RecoSystem-->>Backend: Return generated recommendations
    Backend-->>Frontend: Send recommendations to frontend
    Frontend-->>User: Display recommendations
```

### The Algorithm

The recommendation system is the core of the feed. It is responsible for generating personalized recommendations for each user. The system uses a combination of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to generate recommendations. Inspired by Twitter's recommendation system, we will use a hybrid approach to generate recommendations.

![The Algorithm](../assets/system-diagram.png)

Since this system is too complex for a short period of time, we will start with a simple recommendation system that will generate recommendations based on the user's preferences. We will use a simple collaborative filtering algorithm to generate recommendations using pg-vector.

<div align="center">

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request] --> B[Backend Recommendation Endpoint]
    B --> C[Fetch User Preferences]
    B --> D[Fetch User Embedding via pg-vector]
    C --> E[Apply Cumulative Filtering]
    D --> F[Apply Content-Based Filtering]
    E --> G[Combine & Rank Hybrid Approach]
    F --> G
    G --> H[Final Recommendations]
```
and the pg-vector flow looks like this

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CL as Client (e.g., psql or app)
    participant PG as PostgreSQL
    participant PV as pg-vector Extension

    CL->>PG: SELECT * FROM posts<br>ORDER BY embedding <-> query_embedding<br>LIMIT 5
    PG->>PV: Calculate vector similarity
    PV-->>PG: Return sorted results
    PG-->>CL: Top matching rows

```
